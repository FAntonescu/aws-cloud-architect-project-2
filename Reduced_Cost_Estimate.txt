In order to decrease the monthly cost, I chose to reduce the instance type of the EC2 instances running the application servers to t4g.xlarge with 4 vCPU and 16 GiB memory instead of 8 vCPU and 32GiB memory as in the initial estimation. In addition I switch the pricing strategy from Standard reserved instances to Compute Saving Plans with one year reservation. The number of application servers is decreased to 16.

The number web server EC2 instances is reduced to 8 instances. The type is changed to T4g.large with  2 vCPUs and 16 GiB memory. 

The database instance is switched to db.r4.8xlarge from the previous db.r4.16xlarge.

These changes have as effect reducing the monthly cost from $8200 to $6300.
