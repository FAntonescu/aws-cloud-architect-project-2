After increasing the budget to $20000 per month I increase the number of application server instances to 70 and the instance type to t4g.2xlarge with 8vCPU and 32GiB memory, billed on demand. Also the number of web servers instances is increased to 20 and the instance type is increased to t4g.xlarge with 4vCPUs and 16 GiB memory. The increased number of web servers and application servers would help better distribute the workload and increase the overall performance.
